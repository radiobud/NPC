Page in draft stage.
Tentative plan: General guide for beginners BY an intermediate/BEGINNER in structuring and styling pet pages and user lookups, working with the flow of NPC.
<aside>DISCLAIMER: I'm not a web development pro. I'm still learning these things too! I'm making this page because 1) it will give me a place to store things I learn too, and 2) I think it can be valuable to learn alongside each other.

<h3>Using selectors to work with site code</h3>
<p>A user lookup has multiple key objects: the account age/info, the shield, pets, trophies. We can't remove these! But you can, for example, change the background of those areas to your own theme. Or select a specific pet and overlay custom art (that does not mis-represent what it is!).</p>
<p>Most of the Neo elements use IDs or classes, so you need to select those in your CSS. How to do this?</p>
<h4>Dev Tools</h4>
<pre>To add:
screenshots of inspected elements
example work-through with my petpage or lookup?
STILL TO DO:
positioning? in the tricks section

<h2>Debugging - common problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dev tools and element selector - when in doubt, identify the element</li>
<li>Font contrast issues: change font, add shape beneath, change bg</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Fun specifics to try</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an element off in the corner (absolute positioning)</li>
<li>Pet image overlay</li>
<li>Style all your links at once</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example layouts</h2>

<h2>"Manifesto"</h2>
I want this to be a middle ground for people who want to make something of their page, but who don't want to drop in templates - or who can't find templates that work for them.
When it comes to coding, most people learn by doing - piece by piece, trying out new tools and skills. I (personally!) find it overwhelming to try to review code in one big chunk, unless it's my own. Even then!
Comments help. Good formatting helps. Frequent checks (debugs) help.
Dev tools.
