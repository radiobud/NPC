I want my guides to be a middle ground for people who want to be hands-on with their code, whether editing or making your own layout.
Most people learn by doing - piece by piece. I did. And I'm still a beginner!<br>This is intro CSS, but some familiarity with HTML helps.</article>

    <article>

<h3>Why CSS?</h3>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a collection of rules.</p>
<p>HTML is the content of the page.<br> CSS is the styling.</p>
<p>CSS is not magic - it's just giving orders.</p>
<h3>The nice thing about CSS, in my opinion:<br>it is very readable.</h3>
<p>The rules are structured the same way every time.
</p>
<p>Pick the <b>header</b> of the page and say "Your background color will be: <b>lavender</b>."</p>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/structure-1nostyle.png">
<br>
<br>
<h3>Put WAY more simply,<br>The CSS above is saying:</h3>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/structure-2nostyle.png">
<br>
<p>Pick one element of the page, and put all the rules for that element inside {curly braces}.<br>Separate each rule with a semicolon.</p>
<p>You can list many rules for one element inside the same set of curly braces. Make sure that all rules, even the LAST one, end in a semicolon.</p>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/structure-3nostyle.png"><br><br>
<h3>In CSS terminology, each of those parts is:</h3>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/structure-general-nostyle.png">
<p>Let's break down each color-coded part of the structure:</p>
 <ul>
        <li><span class="yellow">Selector:</span> Tag that identifies which content your rule affects.
        </li>
        <li><span class="green">Brackets:</span> The curly braces that surround each selector's ruleset.
        </li>
        <li><span class="ltblue">Property:</span> One characteristic, like "color" or "width"
        </li>
        <li><span class="orange">Value:</span> Setting for the property, like "red" or "500px"
        </li>
        <li><span class="orange">Semicolon:</span> Ends each property rule, including the last one before the curly brace.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
<p>If I can give you one thing from this section, it's this:</p>
<p>Learn the structure of the CSS. If you are comfortable reading the structure, you will know what to look for when you want to customize premade code, or troubleshoot. You can always look up specifics, like "how to center a div", but you'll work more confidently with the basic foundation.</p>
<p>If you want a playground to try coding and not struggle with all the NPC header stuff, use a petpage (not a lookup). They are a blank slate, so you can see the results of your work much more accurately.</p>

    <h1 id="two">HTML + CSS</h1>

<article>
    <h2>What is CSS selecting? HTML.</h2>
<p>
The selectors above are targeting something that is IN the HTML.</p>
<p>Without getting into fancy stuff, there are three common types of selectors: elements, classes, and IDs.</p>
Element - General HTML chunk. <i>example:</i><b> div, header</b>
<br>Class - Category you make. <i>example:</i><b> .navbar, .gothParagraph</b>
<br>ID - SINGLE element you name. example:</i><b> #bibliography</b>

<p>These can also be combined. You can select all the p elements within a div, for example, like this:</p>
<pre>div p {color: red;}</pre>
<p>You can list multiple selectors for one ruleset, separated with commas. Like this:</p>
<pre>.hdr, .navhover, .footertext {display:none;}</pre>
</article>
<article>
<h3>How to Use HTML to Your Advantage</h3>
<p>Classes and IDs are a part of the HTML. <br>If this is NPC code, you've got to figure those out in order to select the right thing. If it's your code, then you get to name your own classes or IDs. Here is some sample HTML:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;section&gt;

       &lt;div>
        &lt;p>Hello World&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Wow!&lt;p>
       &lt;/div> 

       &lt;div>
        &lt;p>Goodnight Moon&lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Zzzz&lt;p>
       &lt;/div>

    &lt;/section>
</pre>
<p>When there are multiple elements that you want to style the same way, you can give them a class.</p>
<p>If we have more unique elements, then ID is appropriate.</p>
<pre>
    &lt;section&gt;

       &lt;div class="greeting">
        &lt;p>Hello World&lt;/p>
        &lt;p id="red">Wow!&lt;p>
       &lt;/div> 

       &lt;div class="greeting">
        &lt;p>Goodnight moon&lt;/p>
        &lt;p id="blue">Zzzz&lt;p>
       &lt;/div>
       
    &lt;/section>
</pre>

<p>You can get WAY more nuanced. I recommend the browser game <a href="https://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> for practice. It helps you get comfortable with all types of selectors, plus gives you a greater understanding of how CSS works with HTML.</p>

    <h2>Heads up: Style Tags</h2>
<p>All the coding you will do on NPC is in an HTML document. The browser reads it all as HTML, and your CSS will not work unless you tell the browser, "HEY! This part is CSS."</p>
<p>There is an HTML tag for that - the style element. Everthing inside the style tag will be read as CSS.</p>
<p>In general, your &lt;style&gt; section should all be together at the top of the document.</p>

    <h1 id="three">Putting it Together</h1>
        <article>
<h2>Let's write some code.</h2>
<p>Plan first.</p>
<p>Here's the content I want (HTML):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pic of a cat</li>
    <li>Header that says "Goth Cat says"
    </li>
    <li>Text under the cat that says "You have no idea how goth I am"</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's the design (CSS):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Center everything</li>
    <li>Pic not too big</li>
    <li>Dotted border around the cat</li>
    <li>For text, black background and pink font</li>
    <li>Fancy header font</li>
</ul>
<h3>Time to make it.</h3>
<p>We'll start with the HTML, since it's the main content.</p>
<p>(These screenshots are from my code editor, VSCode. I'm sorry it's not text you can copy-paste; I'll run out of character space!)</p>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/ex-html-noclass.png">

<p>Now, we want a background on all the text: the header and p element. Let's give them the same class, then. I'll call the text class "goth."</p>
<p>And I'm also going to give the container div a class of "demo" - mainly because there are usually LOTS of other divs on a page, and I don't want to format ALL of them with this.</p>
<h3>Add class names</h3>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/ex-html-wclass.png">
<p>Perfect. Our HTML is ready to be styled. That means it's...</p>

<h2>CSS Time, Bay-BEE!</h2>
<p>I'll drop it all at once and then break it down with you. See what you can parse just from reading it, though.</p>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/ex-css.png">
<p>In CSS, you can comment with slash and asterisk around your text. A code comment will not take effect or be visible on the page, but it helps you leave more info.</p>
<img src="https://file.garden/aSuzW6Q8vUmjy3BN/NPC/pics/css-basics/ex-css-breakdown.png">
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>For the record, if you put this on a pet lookup, it will end up something like this:</p>
